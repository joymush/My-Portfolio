        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>My highest level of education is a Diploma in information technology</p> 

        <p>I decided to take a class on programming because i felt that i didn't get to learn alot 
            on coding while at my diploma stage and also because i love coding</p>

        <p>I basically do not have a job experience except for the industrial attachment</p>
